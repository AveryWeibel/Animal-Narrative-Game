// initial waking up as pet
== rat_start ==
*[Wake up.] It’s a little too bright, my body is telling me to find somewhere darker to be. As I open my eyes, I’m greeted by… some kind of foliage?
**[Inspect my surroundings.] This isn’t my bedroom, what are all these plants doing here? And why are these leaves so… big? I start sniffing the air to try and make sense of my surroundings- Wait. Why was that so natural?
***[Look down at myself.] I look down and immediately notice my tiny paws. Why do I have little rat paws? What happened to me?! 
****[Leave the bush.] I run out of the bush and try to find something I can check my reflection in. As I scamper about, I notice how oddly natural it feels to run on all fours.
*****[Check my reflection.] Aha! There’s the park’s pond. I run to the water’s edge and brace myself before confirming my suspicions. Sure enough, the rat that I bought from that shady shopkeeper yesterday is staring back at me.
******Oh no[!], is it because I didn’t heed that warning that they gave me yesterday…? “Be warned, make sure to keep the gate closed, or upon you, misfortune will be imposed.” I can’t stay like this, I gotta find a way to become human again!->rat_with_shopkeeper

*[Sleep in.] Mmm, more sleep sounds nice. I curl my body up some more and tuck my tail over my nose. Very comfy… Wait a second. My tail?
**[Panic.] I wake up with a start. There’s no way I was just thinking about curling up like a little rat, but as I look around me, the idea actually seems more plausible. Everything around me is so big!
***[Look down at myself.] I look down to see little rat paws and a long tail that looks like it connects behind me. This can’t be happening!
****[Try to make sense of my surroundings.] I scamper out of the bush on all fours to try and get an understanding of where I ended up between last night and now, since this is very obviously not my apartment. Something inside me tells me to stay out of the open area in front of me, so I find some cover by a tree. Sitting up on my hind legs and sniffing the air, I realize that I’m at the park near my apartment.
*****[Remember what the shopkeeper said.] Amazement at how natural these rat instincts already feel aside, I try to get some kind of understanding of my situation when a certain phrase creeps back into my mind. “Be warned, make sure to keep the gate closed, or upon you, misfortune will be imposed.” There’s no way that the shopkeeper was telling the truth, but looking at my paws makes me think they actually were serious.
******There’s a person standing nearby[.], looking at me. My instincts tell me to stay away, and that's fine. I have to figure out how to become human again! ->rat_with_shopkeeper

== fish_start ==
* Wait! Water?[] Suddenly, I am completely alert. I frantically try to kick my feet to swim up, gasping for air. But hold up… where are my damn feet. And hold up again… where are my damn arms! AND HOLD UP ONE MORE TIME… WHERE ARE MY DAMN LUNGS. I look down at my body. My once beautiful hands and legs are now replaced with silky golden fins. My once beautiful lungs are now replaced with gills on both sides of my face.
** [Look around.] I observe my surroundings, looking for answers. Out of the corner of my eye, I see the gleam of shiny coins settled in the underwater mud. Using my newly-found aquatic abilities, I paddle down to the one of the shiny coins below, and see a little goldfish staring back at me. Man. Why is this little fish staring at me? How did he even get in there? What an idiot!
*** [Hold up.] Wait... Wait. Wait. Wait! That's not another fish! That's me! I'm the fish! Panicked, I try to shut my eyes, telling myself that this is all just a dream. BUT OF COURSE! GOLDFISH DON'T HAVE EYELIDS! I frantically look around, but alas, the only things around are leafy underwater foliage and algae covered rocks swaying in the water. However beyond the surface of the water, the muffled sounds can be heard in the distance.
**** [Swim Up.] As I swim up to the surface, the muffled noises become clearer and clearer. Those aren't just random sounds. Those are people! Finally! Some help. "I'm here! I'm here!" I call out as I swim faster towards the surface. But as I approach the surface a huge object suddenly lands on the surface of the water above, blocking out the Sun.
***** [Stop Swimming.] I stop in my tracks. The large object sinks into the water, drifing down past me. It's a giant slice of bread? Stunned, I look up again to see several more slices floating down. Where are all these coming from.
****** [Continue Swimming.] Once I read the surface, I see ginormous people spread throughout the area riding bikes, player with their dogs, picnicking in the grass. Ooooh! The park! I'm in the pond at the park! Suddenly, another slice of bread falls from bench in front of the pond, splashing down next to me and creating ripples as it sinks. "Oh... who do we have here?" said the source of the bread rain. ->fish_with_shopkeeper

== dog_start ==
*[Wake up.] It rained the night before and the crisp smell of wet pavement lingered in the air. I bring my paw up to scratch my face… paw? I try to wiggle my fingers but everything feels strange. 
** [Wake up!] The grogginess immediately leaves my body as I startle myself awake. Rather than seeing my bed and the walls of my room, I find myself surrounded by lush green grass and endless blue skies. 
Rather than wiggling my fingers and toes, I find myself with paws and a wagging tail. 
*** I’m suddenly a dog!? [] I quickly jump to my feet and stumble onto all fours. Everything around me feels much larger than it used to be. I am also a lot shorter than I was when I went to sleep.
**** [Check my reflection.] I tried my best to walk to a nearby pond to see my reflection. It felt surprisingly natural to walk on four legs. Peering into the clear water confirmed my theory. I was in the body of my new pet puppy.
***** [Panic.] How could this be? It must be the work of that shady shopkeeper. As soon as they started speaking in riddles, I should have known to leave. Instead, I stuck around and still got cursed. 
They said “Be warned, make sure to keep the gate closed, or upon you, misfortune will be imposed,” and I ignored it! I better look around for a way home. I have to find a way to turn human again! -> dog_with_shopkeeper

*[Sleep in.] Birds can’t stop me from getting my dang sleep. I burrow my head in my arms to block out the sun. Dreamland seems to be getting further away from me and I grow frustrated.
I push myself to sit up but my arms slip beneath me. Looking down, I realize that my hands have been replaced with paws.
** [Panic.] I scream (or whatever the dog equivalent of scream is) and fall over in shock. I turn around and see a fluffy tail tucked between my legs. I couldn’t believe my eyes and begin chasing my tail to see if it was attached to me. 
*** [Panic more.] Sure enough, when I catch my tail, it belongs to me. I take a moment to rest from the exhausting task of chasing my tail as I hear a child say “Look mommy, a puppy!” in the distance.
I scan my surroundings and realize I am in the local park. Despite the familiarity, everything suddenly feels big and scary. 
**** [Remember what the shopkeeper said.] My heart pounds in my chest and I panic. What could have possibly happened to me between yesterday night and this morning? 
Is it possible that the shady shopkeeper was actually telling the truth? “Be warned, make sure to keep the gate closed, or upon you, misfortune will be imposed.” I was so tired that I forgot to close the cage’s gate…
***** I can’t believe this[.] is really happening! I have to find my way home and back into my original human body. -> dog_with_shopkeeper

== cat_start ==

*[begin to purr.]
    Contentedly observing my surroundings, I can see all my kingdom from this park bench...
*[start grooming my fur.] This spot is all out of whack, and this one is pointed the wrong direction. I lick away the grime and put my coat back in order...

- WAIT!!!
This isn't right at all! Where am I? What am I?
* [This must be a dream!]"This must be a dream!" I say out loud, but all that comes out is a long soulful yowl ->cat_with_shopkeeper 

->->

// interaction with shopkeeper as pet
== rat_with_shopkeeper ==
*“Why, hello there, little ball of hair[.”] The shopkeeper greets me with a smile. I feel my fur puff out in annoyance at the new nickname.
**[Squeak in protest.] “Little one?! I’m only little because of you! Change me back into a human!” I squeak back as loud as I can.
“Ah, ah, ah!” They wave their finger back and forth with a laugh. “You didn’t heed my warning, did you? Now look at what you’ve turned into.”
***“Okay, I messed up[!"], but it’s not fair that I have to be cursed like this!” 
“No need to be so rash, you could be cured in a flash! Return home after living out your day as a rat, it’s as simple as that!”
****“Why can’t you just turn me back now?”[] 
The shopkeeper waves my question off and continues. “It’ll be a learning experience for you. Now be off, there’s much for you to see and do!”
->->

== fish_with_shopkeeper ==
* [Look up.] Looking up at the fish feeder, I see that it is that shopkeeper that sold me the fish yesterday. “Quite the predicament you’re in, aren’t ya,” said the Shopkeeper with a smirk. “ “You?! You did this!?”, I shouted angrily. “Hehehe! You should’ve listened to what I said. Now you must suffer the consequences.” the Shopkeeper cackled. Damn. Why didn’t I just put the lid on the stupid fish tank.
** [Continue listening.] Fortunately for you, there is a solution.” the shopkeeper starts. “To make up for your lack of responsibility, you will experience everything from the perspective of your new little fishy. All you must do is return back to your home safe and sound.” My little fish heart dropped. How am I, a damn goldfish, supposed to make it all the way back home. I’m doomed. “Do not fret, my child. Let this be a learning experience for you. There is much for you to do. Be creative. You’ll find a way.” said the Shopkeeper as they stood up to leave, scattering the reminder of the bread along the floor.
->->

== dog_with_shopkeeper ==
* "Little pup seems to have messed up[."]... Hello hello,” the shopkeeper giggles. 
If my adorable puppy face could grimace, it would. Instead, I bark back a reply: “Turn me back into a human now!”
** [Growl as the shopkeeper laughs.] The shopkeeper just laughs again and waves their hand as if my problems were nothing. 
“You didn’t listen, silly pup! ‘Be warned, make sure to keep the gate closed, or upon you, misfortune will be imposed.’ You didn’t listen and your time is up!”
*** "Am I stuck like this forever...?" []
“Fortunately for you, there is a way.” the shopkeeper starts. “To make up for your lack of responsibility, you will be a puppy for the day!.”
**** "WHAT?["] Why? I made a mistake. Can't you just poof me back?"
The shopkeeper ignores me and continues: “Get back home, safe and sound. That will turn the curse around! This is a learning experience just for you! Best be off now. There is a lot to see and do.”
->->

== cat_with_shopkeeper ==
"You have awoken from your nap, and find yourself in my devilish trap!"
* [Turn to face the voice]
- Behind me on the bench is the shopkeeper, I sweear he wasn't there a second ago!
* [Attack!]
    I leap forward, claws extended! The shopkeep brings a robed sleeve to intercept and before I know it I'm wrapped up in a sea of violet fabric..
    "Tsk tsk, I declare, you just missed me by a hair!"
    
    "If you know what's good for you, get back home by ten plus two!"
* [Hiss.]
    "&*\#%? !"
    
   "@?\#%*& !!!" I hiss.
    
    "Such horrendous words, you'd do better chasing birds!"
    
    "I know you seem to be upset, being in the body of your pet."
    
    "But don't despair, listen with care, get back home it's over just there!"
    
* [Meow?] "Why would you do this?" I meow.

"An excellent question this fine morning, you good cat did not heed my warning!"

"In this body you will be trapped, for by my magic you got zapped!"

"Only for a time to ease your stressen, just until you've learned your lesson."

"I you want to leave this feline zone, you got to make it all the way back home!"

- With a whoosh of purple robe, the shopkeeper disappears.

I grab the opening of the bag with my mouth and pull the bag into the water, filling it with water.

You see an young child with a plastic Ziploc bag of candy kneeling over the pond, reaching for a frisbee floating in the pond. You swim up the to child. “Excuse me. Can you please help me out.” you ask, but the child doesn’t seem to notice and continues to reach for the frisbee.
* [Do a little fishy trick] I dive down deep into the water and begin to swim upwards as fast as I can. Breaking the surface of the water, I fly into the air and do a little flip before splashing back into the water. Stunned,  child falls backwards in amazement, spilling his candy out on the floor.  “Hey kid. Can you help me get over to that apartment over there?” you ask, but the kid doesn't respond. Damn. He can't understand me. Suddenly, the child jumps up with a huge grin on his face. "FISHY!" he yells as he lunges forward, plastic bag in hand. He's trying to catch me!
** [SWIM] I dive back into the water to evade the child’s clutches, but his nail snags my side, scrapping some of my scales away. The child falls into the water, dropping the bag and letting out a wail as he struggles to get up in the pond. His mother rushes over from nearby, snatches him out of the water, and runs off to dry her child off.

“Hey, you can have some if you want!” I shout to the nearby dog. His ears perk up and his tail begins to wag as he trots over to the edge of the pond. “Really! I can have it all?!” he says excitedly. “It’s all yours, my friend,” I assure him. The dog begins to happily scarf down each piece of bread instantly, not leaving a single crumb behind. Slobber flings from his mouth as huge droplets
* [Dodge the slobber.] I swim back and forth, dodging the slobber as it hits the water. The dog sits down on the shore, satisfied by his meal. “You’re my friend now. We are friends now.” he says happily, still wagging his tail. “Cool!” I continue, “It just so happens that I’m in quite the situation myself. Do you know a way to get back to that apartment building down the street?” “Hmmm. Let me think.” he says, scratching his ear with his leg. “Oh! Oh! Oh! I have some ideas.” he barks.
** [Listen in.] “There is that smelly river that runs below the building, but all the animals say there is a big monster that lives there.” he says, pointing his nose towards the sewer pipe. “There is also a loud crow over there who knows everything about everything, but man does he love to squawk.” he says, pointing his nose to the telephone pole across the street.
*** [Think.] Hmmm. I should be able to easily swim up the stream to get into the sewer, but I hope I don’t have a run in with that monster. But, oh man! The street?! I’m a fish, how am I supposed to do that! I need to find a way to move on land. The sound of a human calling echoes in the distance making the dog’s ear shoot up again. “My human is calling, I gotta go. Later, friend.” says the dog as he sprints away.

I roll over to entrance of the alley. The stray cat sits atop a metal trash can, a scar running through his right eye, covered by a little eyepatch. He glares down at you with his fur raised. "Excuse me, could I ask you for some help?" you beckon, but the cat says nothing. Instead, he slow begins to stand to his feet, creeping forward as if he is stalking his prey. Wait. Doesn't that me I'm the prey. 
* [Uh oh.] "Well, I can see that you are busy, so I'll catch you later," I say as I begin to roll backwards slowly. Suddenly, the cat lunges forward bearing its claws and hissing loudly. Once of its claws punctures the bag, but falls off in the process, preventing water from escaping. I tumble back quickly onto the sidewalk, evading the cat's attack. The cat slinks back into the darkness of the alleyway once again, still watching and waiting for another time to strike. Whelp. Looks like the alleyway is the cat's territory. Won't be able to find a way in from there.

"I'm lost from home and I need to find away into the apartment up there," I say, gesturing towards my apartment window, "Could you help me out?"

I like shiny. Shiny things are my favorite," he rambles, "Yes. Yes. I know that place, but I want something in return. Something shiny. I like shiny." "Okay.
